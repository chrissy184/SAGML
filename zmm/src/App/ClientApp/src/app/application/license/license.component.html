    <p>A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE</p>
    <p>==========================</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see <a
        href="http://www.cwi.nl" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://www.cwi.nl</a>) in the Netherlands as a
      successor of a language called ABC.&nbsp; Guido remains Python's principal author, although it includes many
      contributions from others.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see <a
        href="http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnri.reston.va.us</a>) in
      Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to <a href="http://BeOpen.com"
        class="external-link" rel="nofollow">BeOpen.com</a> to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.&nbsp; In October of the
      same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope Corporation, see <a href="http://www.zope.com"
        class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://www.zope.com</a>).&nbsp; In 2001, the Python Software Foundation
      (PSF, see <a href="http://www.python.org/psf/" class="external-link"
        rel="nofollow">http://www.python.org/psf/</a>) was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own
      Python-related Intellectual Property.&nbsp; Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of the PSF.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>All Python releases are Open Source (see <a href="http://www.opensource.org" class="external-link"
        rel="nofollow">http://www.opensource.org</a> for the Open Source Definition).&nbsp; Historically, most, but not
      all, Python releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.</p>

    <p>Footnotes:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under the GPL.&nbsp; All Python licenses, unlike
      the GPL, let you distribute a modified version without making your changes open source.&nbsp; The GPL-compatible
      licenses make it possible to combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible, because its license has a choice of law
      clause.&nbsp; According to CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1 is "not
      incompatible" with the GPL.</p>
    <p>Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction to make these releases possible.

    <p>under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use,
      reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either
      on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and</p>
    <p>under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise

    <p>2.2. Effective Date</p>
    <p>The licenses granted in Section&nbsp;2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution
      on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.</p>
    <p>2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope</p>
    <p>The licenses granted in this Section&nbsp;2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights
      or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
      Notwithstanding Section&nbsp;2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:</p>
    <p>for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or</p>
    <p>for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the
      combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or</p>
    <p>under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.</p>
    <p>This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as
      may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section&nbsp;3.4).</p>
    <p>2.4. Subsequent Licenses</p>
    <p>No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a
      subsequent version of this License (see Section&nbsp;10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted
      under the terms of Section&nbsp;3.3).</p>
    <p>2.5. Representation</p>
    <p>Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it
      has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.</p>
    <p>2.6. Fair Use</p>
    <p>This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair
      dealing, or other equivalents.</p>
    <p>2.7. Conditions</p>
    <p>Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section&nbsp;2.1.</p>
    <p>3. Responsibilities</p>
    <p>3.1. Distribution of Source Form</p>
    <p>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which
      You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of
      the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You
      may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.</p>
    <p>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</p>
    <p>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</p>
    <p>such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section&nbsp;3.1, and You
      must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable
      means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and</p>
    <p>You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms,
      provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in the
      Source Code Form under this License.</p>
    <p>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</p>
    <p>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the
      requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software
      with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With
      Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of
      such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the
      Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).</p>
    <p>3.4. Notices</p>
    <p>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices,
      disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
      Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual
      inaccuracies.</p>
    <p>3.5. Application of Additional Terms</p>
    <p>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or
      more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any
      Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation
      is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such
      Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
      disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</p>
    <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the
      Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this
      License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such
      description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this
      License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed
      for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</p>
    <p>5. Termination</p>
    <p>5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its
      terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
      are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants,
      and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable
      means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
      Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some
      reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such
      Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.</p>
    <p>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding
      declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or
      indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered
      Software under Section&nbsp;2.1 of this License shall terminate.</p>
    <p>5.3. In the event of termination under Sections&nbsp;5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding
      distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior
      to termination shall survive termination.</p>
    <p>6. Disclaimer of Warranty</p>
    <p><em>Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either
        expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of
        defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and
        performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You
        (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of
        warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this
        License except under this disclaimer.</em></p>
    <p>7. Limitation of Liability</p>
    <p><em>Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or
        otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to
        You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without
        limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
        and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of
        such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting
        from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not
        allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may
        not apply to You.</em></p>
    <p>8. Litigation</p>
    <p>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant
      maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction,
      without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to
      bring cross-claims or counter-claims.</p>
    <p>9. Miscellaneous</p>
    <p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this
      License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
      enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the
      drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.</p>
    <p>10. Versions of the License</p>
    <p>10.1. New Versions</p>
    <p>Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section&nbsp;10.3, no one other than the license
      steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
      distinguishing version number.</p>
    <p>10.2. Effect of New Versions</p>
    <p>You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally
      received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.</p>
    <p>10.3. Modified Versions</p>
    <p>If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you
      may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the
      name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).</p>
    <p>10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses</p>
    <p>If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this

    <p>SOFTWARE TOOLS LICENSE AGREEMENT</p>
    <p>DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, ACCESS, COPY, OR USE ANY PORTION OF THE MATERIALS (DEFINED BELOW) UNTIL YOU HAVE READ
      AND ACCEPTED THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. BY INSTALLING, COPYING, ACCESSING, OR USING THE
      MATERIALS, YOU AGREE TO BE LEGALLY</p>
    <p>BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. If You do not agree to be bound by, or the entity for whose
      benefit You act has not authorized You to accept, these terms and conditions, do not install, access, copy, or use
      the Software and destroy all copies of the Software in Your possession.</p>
    <p>This DEVELOPMENT TOOLS LICENSE AGREEMENT (this “Agreement”) is entered into between Intel Corporation, a Delaware
      corporation (“Intel”) and You. “You” refers to you or your employer or other entity for whose benefit you act, as
      applicable. If you are agreeing to the terms and conditions of this&nbsp; Agreement on behalf of a company or
      other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the legal authority to bind that legal entity to the
      Agreement, in which case, "You" or "Your" shall be in reference to such entity. Intel and You are referred to
      herein individually as a “Party” or, together, as the “Parties”.</p>
    <p>The Parties, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained in this Agreement, and for other good and
      valuable consideration, the receipt and&nbsp; sufficiency of which they acknowledge, and intending to be legally
      bound, agree as follows:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>1.&nbsp; DEFINITIONS. The following definitions are used throughout this Agreement:</p>
    <p>“Affiliate” means any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with a Party hereto, where
      “control” means the direct or indirect ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of such entity’s capital or
      equivalent voting rights. An entity will be deemed an “Affiliate” only as long as such control exists during the
      term of this Agreement.</p>
    <p>“Contractor” means a third party consultant or subcontractor who requires access to or use of the Materials to
      perform work on Your behalf or at Your behest.</p>
    <p>“Development Tools” means the development, evaluation, production, or test tool software, and associated
      documentation or other collateral, identified in the “development_tools.txt” text files, if any, included in the
      Materials.</p>
    <p>“Derivatives” means derivative works as defined in 17 U.S.C § 101 et seq.</p>
    <p>“Intel-based Device” means a device designed, manufactured, or configured by You or Your Affiliates to include or
      operate Intel hardware, software, or services.</p>
    <p>"Materials" means the software, documentation, the software product serial number and license key codes (if
      applicable), Development Tools, Redistributables, and other materials or collateral, including any updates and
      upgrades thereto, in source code or object code form where applicable, that are provided or otherwise made
      available by Intel to You under this Agreement. “Materials” do not include Open Source Software or any
      computer&nbsp; programming code that is subject to an agreement, obligation or license (whether or not
      accompanying the Materials) intended to supersede this Agreement.</p>
    <p>"Redistributables" means the software, documentation, or other collateral identified in the “redist.txt” text
      files, if any, included in the Materials.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>2.&nbsp; LIMITED LICENSE.</p>
    <p>(A)&nbsp; Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Intel grants You and Your Affiliates, a limited,
      nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable, worldwide, fully paid-up license during the term of this Agreement,
      without the right to sublicense, under Intel’s copyrights (subject to any third party licensing requirements),
      unless expressly stated otherwise, to:</p>
    <p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; internally reproduce and install a reasonable number of copies of the Materials for Your internal
      use solely for the purposes of designing, developing, manufacturing and testing Intel-based Devices;</p>
    <p>(2)&nbsp; internally reproduce the source code of the Development Tools, if provided to You by Intel, and to
      internally create and reproduce Derivatives of the Development Tools, and to internally reproduce the binary code
      of the Development Tools, or any Derivatives created by You, in each case solely for the purpose of designing,
      developing, manufacturing and testing the Intel-based Device, solely as necessary for the integration of any Intel
      software and the output generated by the Development Tools, with and into Intel-based Devices;</p>
    <p>(3)&nbsp; create Derivatives of the Redistributables, or any portions thereof, provided to You by Intel in source
      code form solely for the purposes of designing, developing, debugging, modifying, distributing and testing
      software containing significantly more functionality and features than the Redistributables in the form provided
      to You by Intel;</p>
    <p>(4)&nbsp; distribute (or otherwise make available) on a royalty-free basis, subject to any other terms and
      conditions which may appear in the Redistributables text files, the Redistributables, including any Derivatives of
      the Redistributables pursuant to Section 2(A)(3), or any portions thereof, only as integrated or embedded in
      software (and not on a stand-alone basis) solely for use on an Intel-based Device; and</p>
    <p>(5)&nbsp; have the tasks set forth in Section 2(A)(1) and (2) above performed by a Contractor on the conditions
      that You enter into a written confidentiality agreement with any such Contractor, subject to Section 7
      (Confidentiality), and You remain fully liable to Intel for the actions and inactions of Your Contractors.</p>
    <p>(B) You will be liable for Your Affiliate’s breach of these terms. In addition, You acknowledge that Your
      Affiliates are beneficiaries of the licenses granted by Intel under Section 2.</p>
    <p>(C)&nbsp;&nbsp; Intel hereby grants You the right to sub-license (without rights to further sublicense) the
      Development Tools, including any accompanying documentation, to Your manufacturing partners, in the code format
      provided to You by Intel, solely for designing, developing, manufacturing and testing the Intel-based Devices
      solely as necessary for the integration of any Intel software and the output generated by the Development Tools,
      with and into Intel-based Devices. The sublicense is subject to a written sublicensing agreement that contains
      confidentiality obligations and license restrictions that are no less protective of Intel than those provided in
      this Agreement. You will be fully responsible and liable towards Intel for Your sub-licensees’ compliance with all
      such confidentiality obligations and license restrictions. You may grant Your manufacturing partners the right to
      further distribute Redistributables solely as integrated or embedded in software for Your Intel-based Devices.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>3.&nbsp; LICENSE RESTRICTIONS. All right, title and interest in and to the Materials and associated documentation
      are and will remain the exclusive property of Intel and its suppliers. Unless expressly permitted under the
      Agreement, You will not, and will not allow any third party to (i) use, copy, distribute, sell or offer to sell
      the Materials or associated documentation; (ii) modify, adapt, enhance, disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer,
      change or create derivative works from the Materials except and only to the extent as specifically required by
      mandatory applicable laws or any applicable third party license terms accompanying the Materials; (iii) use or
      make the Materials available for the use or benefit of third parties; or (iv) use the Materials on Your products
      other than those that include the Intel product(s), platform(s), or software identified in the Materials; or (v)
      publish or provide any Materials benchmark or&nbsp; comparison test results.</p>
    <p>If You received the Materials solely for evaluation purposes, You have no distribution rights to the Materials or
      any portion thereof.</p>
    <p>Distribution of the Redistributables is also subject to the following conditions: You shall: (i) be solely
      responsible to Your customers and end users for any update or support obligation or other liability which may
      arise from the distribution, (ii) not make any statement that Your software is "certified", or that its
      performance is guaranteed, by Intel, (iii) not use Intel's name or trademarks to promote Your software without
      prior written permission, (iv) use a license agreement that contains provisions that are at least as restrictive
      as this Agreement and which prohibits disassembly and reverse engineering of the Materials provided in object code
      form, and (v) indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Intel, Intel’s Affiliates, and its licensors from and against
      any claims or lawsuits, including attorney's fees, that arise or result from Your Derivatives or Your distribution
      of Your software.</p>
    <p>The consideration under this Agreement is only for the licenses Intel expressly grants above. Any other rights
      including, but not limited to, additional patent rights, will require an additional license and additional
      consideration. Nothing in this Agreement requires or will be treated to require Intel to grant any additional
      license. You acknowledge that an essential basis of the bargain in this Agreement is that Intel grants You no
      licenses or other rights including, but not limited to, patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark, trade name,
      service mark or other intellectual property licenses or rights with respect to the Materials and associated
      documentation, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, except for the licenses expressly granted above. You
      acknowledge there are significant uses of the Materials in their original, unmodified and uncombined form. The
      consideration for the licenses in this Agreement reflects Intel’s continuing right to assert patent claims against
      any modifications or derivative works (including, without limitation, error corrections and bug fixes) of, or
      combinations with, the Materials that You, Your Affiliates or third parties make that infringe any Intel patent
      claim.</p>
    <p>4.&nbsp; LICENSE TO FEEDBACK. This Agreement does not obligate You to provide Intel with materials, information,
      comments, suggestions, Your Derivatives or other communication regarding the features, functions, performance or
      use of the Materials (“Feedback”). If any software included in the Materials is provided or otherwise made
      available by Intel in source code form, to the extent You provide Intel with Feedback in a tangible form, You
      grant to Intel and its affiliates a non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable, irrevocable, worldwide,
      royalty-free, fully paid-up and transferable license, to and under all of Your intellectual property rights,
      whether perfected or not, to publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, use, make, have made, sell, offer for
      sale, distribute, import, create derivative works of and otherwise exploit any comments, suggestions,
      descriptions, ideas, Your Derivatives or other feedback regarding the Materials provided by You or on Your behalf.
    </p>
    <p>5.&nbsp; OPEN SOURCE STATEMENT. The Materials may include Open Source Software (OSS) licensed pursuant to OSS
      license agreement(s) identified in the OSS comments in the applicable source code file(s) and/or file header(s)
      provided with or otherwise associated with the Materials. Neither You nor any Original Equipment Manufacturer
      (OEM), Original Device Manufacturer (ODM), customer, or distributor may subject any proprietary portion of the
      Materials to any OSS license obligations including, without limitation, combining or distributing the Materials
      with OSS in a manner that subjects Intel, the Materials or any portion thereof to any OSS license obligation.
      Nothing in this Agreement limits any rights under, or grants rights that supersede, the terms of any applicable
      OSS license.</p>
    <p>6.&nbsp; THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE. Certain third party software provided with or within the Materials may only be
      used (a) upon securing a license directly from the owner of the software or (b) in combination with hardware
      components purchased from such third party and (c) subject to further license limitations&nbsp; by the software
      owner. A listing of any such third party limitations is in one or more text files accompanying the Materials. You
      acknowledge Intel is not providing You with a license to such third party software and further that it is Your
      responsibility to obtain appropriate licenses from such third parties directly.</p>
    <p>7.&nbsp; CONFIDENTIALITY. The terms and conditions of this Agreement, exchanged confidential information, as well
      as the Materials are subject to the terms and conditions of the Non-Disclosure Agreement(s) or Intel Pre-Release
      Loan Agreement(s) (referred to herein collectively or individually as “NDA”) entered into by and in force between
      Intel and You, and in any case no less confidentiality protection than You apply to Your information of similar
      sensitivity. If You would like to have a Contractor perform work on Your behalf that requires any access to or use
      of Materials You must obtain a written confidentiality agreement from the Contractor which contains terms and
      conditions with respect to access to or use of Materials no less restrictive than those set forth in this
      Agreement, excluding any distribution rights and use for any other purpose, and You will remain fully liable to
      Intel for the actions and inactions of those Contractors. You may not use Intel's name in any publications,
      advertisements, or other announcements without Intel's prior written consent.</p>
    <p>8.&nbsp; NO OBLIGATION; NO AGENCY. Intel may make changes to the Software, or items referenced therein, at any
      time without notice. Intel is not obligated to support, update, provide training for, or develop any further
      version of the Software or to grant any license thereto. No agency, franchise, partnership, joint- venture, or
      employee-employer relationship is intended or created by this&nbsp; Agreement.</p>
    <p>9.&nbsp; EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES. THE MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
      ANY KIND INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Intel does
      not warrant or assume responsibility&nbsp;&nbsp; for the accuracy or completeness of any information, text,
      graphics, links or other items within the Materials.</p>
    <p>10.&nbsp; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL INTEL OR ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS (INCLUDING
      THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS) BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING,
      WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOST DATA) ARISING OUT OF OR IN RELATION TO THIS
      AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE MATERIALS, EVEN IF INTEL HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
      POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS PROHIBIT EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR IMPLIED
      WARRANTIES OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY IN PART NOT APPLY TO YOU. YOU MAY
      ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. THE MATERIALS LICENSED HEREUNDER ARE NOT
      DESIGNED&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OR INTENDED FOR USE IN ANY MEDICAL, LIFE SAVING OR LIFE SUSTAINING SYSTEMS,
      TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, NUCLEAR SYSTEMS, OR FOR ANY OTHER MISSION CRITICAL APPLICATION IN WHICH THE FAILURE OF THE
      DEVELOPMENT TOOLS COULD LEAD TO PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH. YOU WILL INDEMNIFY AND HOLD INTEL AND ITS AFFILIATES,
      LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS (INCLUDING THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS,&nbsp; EMPLOYEES,&nbsp; AND&nbsp;
      AGENTS)&nbsp; HARMLESS&nbsp; AGAINST&nbsp; ALL&nbsp; CLAIMS,&nbsp; LIABILITIES,&nbsp; LOSSES,&nbsp; COSTS,&nbsp;
      DAMAGES,&nbsp; AND&nbsp; EXPENSES&nbsp; (INCLUDING REASONABLE</p>
    <p>ATTORNEY FEES), ARISING OUT OF, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE MATERIALS AND ANY CLAIM OF
      PRODUCT LIABILITY, PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH ASSOCIATED WITH ANY UNINTENDED USE, EVEN IF SUCH CLAIM ALLEGES THAT
      INTEL OR AN INTEL AFFILIATE, LICENSOR OR SUPPLIER WAS NEGLIGENT REGARDING THE DESIGN OR MANUFACTURE OF THE
      MATERIALS. THE LIMITED REMEDIES, WARRANTY DISCLAIMER AND LIMITED LIABILITY ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS
      OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN INTEL AND YOU AND INTEL WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE MATERIALS WITHOUT SUCH&nbsp;
      LIMITATIONS.</p>
    <p>11.&nbsp; TERMINATION AND SURVIVAL. Intel may terminate this Agreement for any reason with thirty (30) days’
      notice and immediately if You or someone acting on Your behalf or at Your behest violates any of its terms or
      conditions. Upon termination You will immediately destroy and ensure the destruction of the Materials (including
      providing certification of such destruction or return back to Intel). Upon termination of this Agreement, all
      licenses granted to You hereunder terminate immediately. All Sections of this Agreement, except Section 2, will
      survive termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement, the license grant to any Redistributables,
      including Your Derivatives of the Redistributables, distributed by You prior to the effective date of such
      termination and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall survive any such termination
      of this Agreement.</p>
    <p>12.&nbsp; GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION. This Agreement and any dispute arising out of or relating to it will be
      governed by the laws of the U.S.A. and Delaware, without regard to conflict of laws principles. The Parties
      exclude the application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (1980).
      The state and federal courts sitting in Delaware, U.S.A. will have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute arising
      out of or relating to this Agreement. The Parties consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in those courts. A
      Party that obtains a judgment against the other Party in the courts identified in this section may enforce that
      judgment in any court that has jurisdiction over the Parties.</p>
    <p>13.&nbsp; EXPORT REGULATIONS/EXPORT CONTROL. You agree that neither You nor Your subsidiaries or Affiliates will
      export/re-export the Materials, directly&nbsp; or indirectly, to any country for which the U.S. Department of
      Commerce or any other agency or department of the U.S. Government or the foreign government from where it is
      shipping requires an export license, or other governmental approval, without first obtaining any such required
      license or approval. In the event the Materials are exported from the U.S.A. or re-exported from a foreign
      destination by You, Your subsidiaries, or Your Affiliates, You will ensure that the distribution and
      export/re-export or import of the Materials complies with all laws, regulations, orders, or other restrictions of
      the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the appropriate foreign government.</p>
    <p>14.&nbsp; GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS. The Materials are a commercial item (as defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101)
      consisting of commercial computer software and commercial computer software documentation (as those terms are used
      in 48 C.F.R. 12.212). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R 227.7202- 1 through 227.7202-4, You will not
      provide the Materials to the U.S. Government. Contractor or Manufacturer is Intel Corporation, 2200 Mission
      College Blvd., Santa Clara, CA 95054.</p>
    <p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp; TRADEMARKS. Third party trademarks, trade names, product names and logos (the “Trademarks”)
      contained in or used by the Materials are the trademarks or registered trademarks of their respective owners, and
      the use of such Trademarks shall inure to the benefit of the trademark owner. The reference to such Trademarks (if
      any) by Intel in any of the Materials does not constitute: (i) an affiliation by Intel and its licensors with such
      company, or (ii) an endorsement or approval of such company of Intel and its licensors and its products or
      services.</p>
    <p>16.&nbsp; ASSIGNMENT. You may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, the license(s) granted or any of
      Your rights or duties hereunder, expressly, by implication, by operation of law, or otherwise and any attempt to
      do so, without Intel’s express prior written consent, will be null and void. Intel may assign, delegate and
      transfer this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, in its sole discretion.</p>
    <p>17.&nbsp; ENTIRE AGREEMENT; SEVERABILITY. The terms and conditions of this Agreement and any NDA with Intel
      constitute the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and merge and
      supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions. Neither Party
      will be bound by any terms, conditions, definitions, warranties, understandings, or representations with respect
      to the subject matter hereof other than as expressly provided herein. In the event any provision of this Agreement
      is unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law&nbsp; or applicable court decision, such unenforceability or
      invalidity will not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, instead such provision will be
      changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such provision within legal limits.</p>
    <p>18.&nbsp; WAIVER. The failure of a Party to require performance by the other Party of any provision hereof will
      not affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter; nor will waiver by a Party of a
      breach of any provision hereof constitute a waiver of the provision itself.</p>
    <p>19.&nbsp; PRIVACY. YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS ARE SET FORTH IN INTEL’S PRIVACY NOTICE, WHICH FORMS A PART OF THIS
      AGREEMENT. PLEASE REVIEW THE PRIVACY NOTICE AT <a href="HTTP://WWW.INTEL.COM/PRIVACY" class="external-link"

      excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the
      Application, and not on the Linked Version.</p>
    <p>The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the
      Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
      Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.</p>
    <p>1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.</p>
    <p>You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU
      GPL.</p>
    <p>2. Conveying Modified Versions.</p>
    <p>If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be
      supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked),
      then you may convey a copy of the modified version:</p>
    <p>a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application
      does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose
      remains meaningful, or</p>
    <p>b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.</p>
    <p>3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.</p>
    <p>The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library.
      You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not
      limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and
      templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:</p>
    <p>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library
      and its use are covered by this License.</p>
    <p>b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.</p>
    <p>4. Combined Works.</p>
    <p>You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict
      modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging
      such modifications, if you also do each of the following:</p>
    <p>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library
      and its use are covered by this License.</p>
    <p>b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.</p>
    <p>c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the
      Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this
      license document.</p>
    <p>d) Do one of the following:</p>
    <p>0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application
      Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a
      modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6
      of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.</p>
    <p>1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a)
      uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate
      properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.</p>
    <p>e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information
      under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a
      modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version
      of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
      Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
      Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)</p>
    <p>5. Combined Libraries.</p>
    <p>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together
      with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a
      combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:</p>
    <p>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other
      library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.</p>
    <p>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
      where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.</p>
    <p>6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.</p>
    <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License
      from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
      address new problems or concerns.</p>
    <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain
      numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the
      option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by
      the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU
      Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published
      by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
    <p>If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser
      General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
      authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.</p>

    <p align="center"><strong>GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</strong><br> Version 2, June 1991</p>
    <p>Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br> 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA
      02110-1301 USA</p>
    <p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br> of this license document, but changing it is not
      allowed.</p>
    <p>Preamble</p>
    <p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the
      GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure
      the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
      Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software
      Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your
      programs, too.</p>
    <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed
      to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you
      wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces
      of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>
    <p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to
      surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of
      the software, or if you modify it.</p>
    <p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the
      recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
      And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.</p>
    <p>We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you
      legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.</p>
    <p>Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no
      warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients
      to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the
      original authors' reputations.</p>
    <p>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that
      redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
      proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or
      not licensed at all.</p>
    <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</p>
    <p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>
    <p>0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder
      saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any
      such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
      copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
      modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
      the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".</p>
    <p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside
      its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if
      its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
      Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</p>
    <p>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,
      provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
      disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
      and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>
    <p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
      protection in exchange for a fee.</p>
    <p>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the
      Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
      also meet all of these conditions:</p>
    <p>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date
      of any change.</p>
    <p>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from
      the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
      this License.</p>
    <p>c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started
      running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
      appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty)
      and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of
      this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,
      your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</p>
    <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived
      from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this
      License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
      distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the
      whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and
      thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>
    <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by
      you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works
      based on the Program.</p>
    <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on
      the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
      License.</p>
    <p>3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable
      form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</p>
    <p>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the
      terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
    <p>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no
      more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
      corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily
      used for software interchange; or,</p>
    <p>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This
      alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or
      executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</p>
    <p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable
      work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
      definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a
      special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
      source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which
      the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.</p>
    <p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then
      offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
      even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</p>
    <p>4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this
      License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
      automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from
      you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
    </p>
    <p>5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you
      permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
      do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
      Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
      distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.</p>
    <p>6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically
      receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and
      conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
      You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.</p>
    <p>7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not
      limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
      contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you
      cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
      obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license
      would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
      through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
      distribution of the Program.</p>
    <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of
      the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>
    <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to
      contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
      software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous
      contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application
      of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any
      other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.</p>
    <p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this
      License.</p>
    <p>8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by
      copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
      explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in
      or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
      body of this License.</p>
    <p>9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time
      to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
      new problems or concerns.</p>
    <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License
      which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
      that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a
      version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
    <p>10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are
      different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
      Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be
      guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the
      sharing and reuse of software generally.</p>
    <p>NO WARRANTY</p>
    <p>11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED
      BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
      PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
      IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
      PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
      SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
    <p>12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER
      PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING
      ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
      (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
      PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS
      BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
    <p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
    <p>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</p>
    <p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to
      achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>
    <p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source
      file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
      and a pointer to where the full notice is found.</p>
    <p>One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br> Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of
      author&gt;</p>
    <p>This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public
      License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any
      later version.</p>
    <p>This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the
      implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for
      more details.</p>
    <p>You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program; if not, write to the
      Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA</p>
    <p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>
    <p>If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>
    <p>Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for
      details type `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;
      type `show c' for details.</p>
    <p>The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.
      Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
      mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.</p>
    <p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright
      disclaimer" for the program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>
    <p>Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at
      compilers) written by James Hacker.</p>
    <p>signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989<br> Ty Coon, President of Vice</p>
    <p>This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into proprietary programs. If your program
      is a subroutine library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
      library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.</p>

    <p><strong>Eclipse Public License - v 2.0</strong></p>
    <p>THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC LICENSE (“AGREEMENT”). ANY USE,
      REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.</p>
    <p>1. DEFINITIONS</p>
    <p>“Contribution” means:</p>
    <p>a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content Distributed under this Agreement, and</p>
    <p>b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:</p>
    <p>i) changes to the Program, and</p>
    <p>ii) additions to the Program;</p>
    <p>where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are Distributed by that particular
      Contributor. A Contribution “originates” from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor
      itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include changes or additions to the
      Program that are not Modified Works.</p>
    <p>“Contributor” means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.</p>
    <p>“Licensed Patents” mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or
      sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.</p>
    <p>“Program” means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this Agreement.</p>
    <p>“Recipient” means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement or any Secondary License (as applicable),
      including Contributors.</p>
    <p>“Derivative Works” shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other form, that is based on (or derived from)
      the Program and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as
      a whole, an original work of authorship.</p>
    <p>“Modified Works” shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that results from an addition to, deletion
      from, or modification of the contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file in Source
      Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified Works shall not include works that contain only
      declarations, interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely in each case in order to link
      to, bind by name, or subclass the Program or Modified Works thereof.</p>
    <p>“Distribute” means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available in any manner that enables the transfer of
      a copy.</p>
    <p>“Source Code” means the form of a Program preferred for making modifications, including but not limited to
      software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.</p>
    <p>“Secondary License” means either the GNU General Public License, Version 2.0, or any later versions of that
      license, including any exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial Contributor.</p>
    <p>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</p>
    <p>a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
      royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
      Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.</p>
    <p>b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
      royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
      transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the
      Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The
      patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
      licensed hereunder.</p>
    <p>c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth
      herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other
      intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
      exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure
      any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to
      allow Recipient to Distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before
      distributing the Program.</p>
    <p>d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if
      any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.</p>
    <p>e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient
      (other than those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's receipt of the Program under the
      terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).</p>
    <p>3. REQUIREMENTS</p>
    <p>3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:</p>
    <p>a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor
      must accompany the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program is available under this
      Agreement, and informs Recipients how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used
      for software exchange; and</p>
    <p>b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license different than this Agreement, provided that such
      license:</p>
    <p>i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied,
      including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
      merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;</p>
    <p>ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all liability for damages, including direct,
      indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;</p>
    <p>iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code under section 3.2; and</p>
    <p>iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any party to be under a license that satisfies the
      requirements of this section 3.</p>
    <p>3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:</p>
    <p>a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the Program (i) is combined with other material in a
      separate file or files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial Contributor attached to the
      Source Code the notice described in Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available under the
      terms of such Secondary Licenses, and</p>
    <p>b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.</p>
    <p>3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of
      warranty, or limitations of liability (‘notices’) contained within the Program from any copy of the Program which
      they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add their own appropriate notices.</p>
    <p>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</p>
    <p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business
      partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the
      Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
      create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a
      commercial product offering, such Contributor (“Commercial Contributor”) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
      every other Contributor (“Indemnified Contributor”) against any losses, damages and costs (collectively “Losses”)
      arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor
      to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution
      of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or
      Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
      Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the
      Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related
      settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.</p>
    <p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That
      Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or
      offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's
      responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
      Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
      pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.</p>
    <p>5. NO WARRANTY</p>
    <p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS
      PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING,
      WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and
      distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
      including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or
      loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.</p>
    <p>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</p>
    <p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT
      NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR
      CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY,
      WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE
      USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
      POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
    <p>7. GENERAL</p>
    <p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the
      validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the
      parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
      enforceable.</p>
    <p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
      lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
      infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as
      of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
    <p>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms
      or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware
      of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and
      distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this
      Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.</p>
    <p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the
      Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the
      right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the
      Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward.
      The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
      entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including
      Contributions) may always be Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In
      addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program
      (including its Contributions) under the new version.</p>
    <p>Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the
      intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or
      otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this
      Agreement is intended to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient. No third-party
      beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.</p>
    <p>Exhibit A – Form of Secondary Licenses Notice</p>
    <p>“This Source Code may also be made available under the following Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such
      availability set forth in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: &nbsp;[name license(s), version(s),
      and exceptions or additional permissions here].”</p>
    <p>Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A is not sufficient to license the Source Code
      under Secondary Licenses.</p>
    <p>If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then You may include the notice in a
      location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a
      notice.</p>
    <p>You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.</p>

      sold by themselves. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold
      with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
      however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
      license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.</p>
